This project was originally a plan to create the hardware I designed in a fake
hardware description language in a real one that can run on an FPGA since I had
one around for a Computer Architecture class project.

I no longer have an FPGA and I realized this was pretty impractical since
designing ram from logic gates to put on an FPGA is a pretty bad idea, they have
on board ram for a reason. Also I don't really need to ever design hardware so I
wasn't super into learning veralog.

This part will never be completed but I'll just go ahead and leave it up in this
branch anyway.
